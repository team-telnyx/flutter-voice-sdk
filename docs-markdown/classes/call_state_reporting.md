# 📞 Call State and Termination Reason Reporting

This document explains the enhanced call state reporting and termination reason handling in the Telnyx Flutter SDK using the new `enum`-based `CallState` model.

## 🔄 Call States

The SDK defines an `enum` called `CallState`, representing the lifecycle of a call:

```dart
enum CallState {
  newCall,
  connecting,
  ringing,
  active,
  held,
  reconnecting,
  dropped,
  done,
  error
}
```

### State Overview

* `CallState.newCall`: Call created, not yet connected.
* `CallState.connecting`: Attempting to connect.
* `CallState.ringing`: Waiting for an answer.
* `CallState.active`: Call is live.
* `CallState.held`: Call on hold.
* `CallState.reconnecting`: Reconnecting due to network loss.
* `CallState.dropped`: Dropped due to network failure.
* `CallState.done`: Call ended (can include termination reason).
* `CallState.error`: Call setup or runtime error.

## 🌐 Network Reasons

`CallState.reconnecting` and `CallState.dropped` can carry a `NetworkReason` using `withReason()`:

```dart
CallState.reconnecting.withReason(NetworkReason.networkLost);
```

Available reasons:

* `NetworkReason.networkSwitch`: Switched networks.
* `NetworkReason.networkLost`: Lost connectivity.
* `NetworkReason.airplaneMode`: Airplane mode triggered.
* `NetworkReason.serverError`: Backend/server issue.

To access:

```dart
final reason = callState.reason;
print(reason?.message);
```

## 📴 Call Termination Reasons

`CallState.done` can be linked to a `CallTerminationReason` explaining why the call ended.

```dart
CallTerminationReason(
  cause: 'CALL_REJECTED',
  causeCode: 21,
  sipCode: 403,
  sipReason: 'Dialed number not whitelisted'
);
```

## ✅ Usage Example

### Observing Call States

```dart
call.callHandler.onCallStateChanged = (CallState state) {
  switch (state) {
    case CallState.done:
      final reason = state.terminationReason;
      if (reason != null) {
        print('Call ended with SIP code: \${reason.sipCode}');
        print('Cause: \${reason.cause}');
      } else {
        print('Call ended normally');
      }
      break;
    case CallState.dropped:
    case CallState.reconnecting:
      print('Network issue: \${state.reason?.message}');
      break;
    default:
      break;
  }
};
```

### Checking State Flags

```dart
if (callState == CallState.active) {
  // The call is currently active
} else if (callState == CallState.done) {
  final reason = callState.terminationReason;
  // Handle termination
}
```

## 🚨 Error Handling

Socket errors from the Telnyx client are captured via:

```dart
telnyxClient.onSocketErrorReceived = (TelnyxSocketError error) {
  print('Error code: ${error.errorCode}');
  print('Message: ${error.errorMessage}');
};
```

Common error codes:

* `-32000`: Token registration failed
* `-32001`: Credential error
* `-32002`: Codec failure
* `-32003`: Gateway timeout
* `-32004`: Gateway registration failure

Use a switch block to map and handle these accordingly.

## 🔀 Detecting "Answered Elsewhere" (Multi-Device)

When `pushWhenActive` is enabled on more than one device for the same SIP user, an incoming call can be delivered to multiple devices at the same time. As soon as one device answers, Telnyx ends the call on the remaining devices.

From the SDK's perspective, the call ends normally: `call.callHandler.onCallStateChanged` fires with `CallState.done`, and a `CallTerminationReason` may be attached carrying the BYE message details (`cause`, `causeCode`, `sipCode`, `sipReason`). Apps should treat this as a normal multi-device outcome — not as a call failure — and clean up any incoming-call UI, ringtone, or CallKit / ConnectionService session they had started.

See [Push notification setup: Push When Active and Answered Elsewhere](../push-notification/app-setup.md#push-when-active-and-answered-elsewhere) for the full flow and config reference.
